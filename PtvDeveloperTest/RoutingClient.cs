The first waypoint is the start and the last is the destination of the route. Additional intermediate waypoints are possible.   The format of each waypoint is &#x60;&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;[;&lt;attribute&gt;;&lt;attribute&gt;;...]&#x60; representing a point with the latitude value in degrees from south to north and the longitude value in degrees (WGS84/EPSG:4326) from west to east. This point will be matched to the nearest possible road.   By default the air-line connection between given and matched coordinates is not included in the route polyline, distance and duration. We will refer to this type of waypoint as an _on-road waypoint_.  The behaviour of a waypoint can be changed by appending the following attributes:    * &#x60;includeLastMeters&#x60; to include the air-line connection between given and matched coordinates in the route polyline, distance and duration.  We will refer to this type of waypoint as an _off-road waypoint_.  * &#x60;roadAccess&#x3D;&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;&#x60;, to use these coordinates for matching to the nearest road. Implies **includeLastMeter**, i.e.  the air-line connection between the waypoint coordinates and the matched coordinates  is included in the route polyline, distance and duration. This is useful if the waypoint should not be matched to the nearest possible road but to some road further away,  e.g. garage exit at a different road.  * &#x60;matchSideOfStreet&#x60;, specifies that this waypoint will be reached at the side of street on which it is located.  This is useful to prevent the driver from crossing the street to actually reach the location represented by this waypoint.  * &#x60;radius&#x3D;&lt;distance&gt;&#x60;, influences the route course, so that the route passes an area defined by the given radius [m] (integer value).  This waypoint will not appear as a waypoint event in the response and may not be used as start and destination.  &#x60;radius&#x60; must be &gt; 0 and is not compatible with any other attribute on the same waypoint except for &#x60;name&#x60;.  We will refer to this type of waypoint as a _route-manipulation waypoint_.  * &#x60;name&#x3D;&lt;name of waypoint&gt;&#x60;, is an identifier to reference this waypoint in the response.  * In order to influence the route course so that the route uses a specific ferry or railway connection between two locations the waypoint is formatted as follows:  &#x60;combinedTransport&#x3D;&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;,&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;&#x60;. Both locations will be matched to the nearest ports looking for a direct connection.

If more than one connection is found, the best one will be used,  and the alternative connections will be returned in the response in a warning _ROUTING_COMBINED_TRANSPORT_WAYPOINT_AMBIGUOUS_.

This is useful to prevent the driver from crossing the street to actually reach the location represented by this waypoint.  * &#x60;radius&#x3D;&lt;distance&gt;&#x60;, influences the route course, so that the route passes an area defined by the given radius [m] (integer value).

The first waypoint is the start and the last is the destination of the route. Additional intermediate waypoints are possible.   The format of each waypoint is &#x60;&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;[;&lt;attribute&gt;;&lt;attribute&gt;;...]&#x60; representing a point with the latitude value in degrees from south to north and the longitude value in degrees (WGS84/EPSG:4326) from west to east. This point will be matched to the nearest possible road.   By default the air-line connection between given and matched coordinates is not included in the route polyline, distance and duration. We will refer to this type of waypoint as an _on-road waypoint_.  The behaviour of a waypoint can be changed by appending the following attributes:    * &#x60;includeLastMeters&#x60; to include the air-line connection between given and matched coordinates in the route polyline, distance and duration.  We will refer to this type of waypoint as an _off-road waypoint_.  * &#x60;roadAccess&#x3D;&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;&#x60;, to use these coordinates for matching to the nearest road. Implies **includeLastMeter**, i.e.  the air-line connection between the waypoint coordinates and the matched coordinates  is included in the route polyline, distance and duration. This is useful if the waypoint should not be matched to the nearest possible road but to some road further away,  e.g. garage exit at a different road.  * &#x60;matchSideOfStreet&#x60;, specifies that this waypoint will be reached at the side of street on which it is located.  This is useful to prevent the driver from crossing the street to actually reach the location represented by this waypoint.  * &#x60;radius&#x3D;&lt;distance&gt;&#x60;, influences the route course, so that the route passes an area defined by the given radius [m] (integer value).

We will refer to this type of waypoint as a _route-manipulation waypoint_.  * &#x60;name&#x3D;&lt;name of waypoint&gt;&#x60;, is an identifier to reference this waypoint in the response.  * In order to influence the route course so that the route uses a specific ferry or railway connection between two locations the waypoint is formatted as follows:  &#x60;combinedTransport&#x3D;&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;,&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;&#x60;. Both locations will be matched to the nearest ports looking for a direct connection.
